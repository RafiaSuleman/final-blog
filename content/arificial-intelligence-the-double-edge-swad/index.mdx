# Artificial intelligence: A Double-edged Sword?
As the name suggests, artificial intelligence (AI) is applications and machines programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The center of simulated intelligence is to prepare PCs to understand like people - picking up, thinking, critical thinking, insight, and language getting it. 
## The Intricacies of AI: What Makes It Trick?
The magic behind AI's incredible capabilities is a combination of several technologies and techniques:
### Machine Learning (ML):
Have you heard the phrase "The machine learns from its experience" before? ML is what they are referring to. AI is a strategy for information investigation that mechanizes logical model structure. It is the foundation of AI, providing the data needed to make decisions.
### Neural Networks: 
Now, these are closer to human function. Neural networks mimic the way human brains operate, enabling machines to think and learn from experience.
### Deep Learning:
This is machine learning on steroids. Deep learning is a more advanced variant of ML, significantly enhancing the way machines learn from their experiences.
## Why is AI Important?
Simply put, AI makes things easier. It improves efficiency, saves time, heck, even saves lives in medical applications. However, the value of AI doesn't just lie in its applications. It also lies in its potential. AI has the potential to completely redefine the way we exist and interact with technology.
In any case, likewise, with any earth-shattering innovation, it accompanies its stars and its cons. Is it an aid or a revile? Let's find out!
Pros of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Undeniably, AI has pushed the frontiers of human possibility.
### Improving Efficiency
 AI intelligence can perform undertakings at a speed exceptional to human capacity. 
Example
 ### Data analysis
 Artificial intelligence can examine far bigger datasets in a small part of the time it would take a human analyst.
 ### 24/7 Availability
Machines don’t require frequent breaks, allowing for uninterrupted work. Imagine the increase in productivity. 
Example
AI-powered customer service chatbots can answer user queries around the clock without any downtime.
 
### Reducing Human Error
 by nature, humans make mistakes. However, AI, if programmed correctly, has a lower chance of error. AI aids in making precise decisions based on pre-fed algorithms, slashing human errors. For instance, GPS technology, driven by AI, makes navigation simple and error-free.
Example
An illustration of the decrease in human blunder through artificial intelligence is the utilization of mechanical medical procedure frameworks, which can carry out complex techniques with accuracy and exactness, lessening the gamble of human mistakes and working on quiet security in medical services.
### Automating Jobs
 Many jobs, particularly in manufacturing, have been automated thanks to AI, thus increasing efficiency and productivity.
Example
Expert system machines will most likely mechanize information sections, routine client assistance, and mechanical production system work. They are dreary and require negligible direction.
### Unbiased Decisions
Individuals are driven by feelings, regardless of whether they like them. Computer-based intelligence, then again, is absent of any trace of desire and is exceptionally useful and reasonable in its methodology. An enormous benefit of computerized reasoning is that it has no one-sided sees, which guarantees more exact direction.
Example
An illustration of this is man-made intelligence-controlled enlistment frameworks that screen work candidates given abilities and capabilities as opposed to socioeconomics.
### Personalization 
Artificial intelligence empowers customized encounters and suggestions for clients..
Example
Such as personalized product recommendations on e-commerce websites or content suggestions on streaming platforms.
### Assistance in Complex tasks
Computer-based intelligence can help human undertakings.
Example
Drug disclosure, environment demonstrating, space investigation, overwhelming data, and creating knowledge.
But on the flip side, what are the potential pitfalls we need to watch out for?
## Downsides of Artificial Intelligence
Despite the advantages, AI isn't without its flaws.
### Job Displacement
While automation may increase efficiency, it also results in job losses. This is especially true in sectors like manufacturing, where repetitive tasks can be easily automated.
Establishing AI infrastructure requires high initial investment, not to mention maintenance costs. Furthermore, AI must run on the latest hardware and software to stay current and meet the latest requirements, so it can be pretty expensive.
### No Creativity
The machine might be fast and error-free, but it lacks the human capacity for creativity and innovation. While it can help create, it cannot itself create or think as humans do.
### Dependency
Increased dependency on machines could lead to intellectual laziness. With GPS, for instance, our navigation skills may get rusty.
## Four Types of AI
 AI has evolved over the years, giving birth to four distinct types:
### Reactive Machines
These are the simplest forms of AI essentially designed to react to specific situations. They can't recall past data. A quintessential example is IBM's Deep Blue, a chess program.
### Limited Memory
These AI systems can store past information temporarily. Your self-driving car, for instance,  uses sensors to retain data about its surroundings and make decisions accordingly.
### Theory of Mind
This type of AI is still in the research phase and would have the capability to understand and react to people's emotions, beliefs, etc.
### Self-aware AI
This is the future of AI — machines with self-awareness and consciousness. However, this remains a theoretical concept for now.
The Dawn of Artificial Intelligence in Our Daily Routine
Artificial Intelligence, a cutting-edge technology, has already carved a niche for itself in a multitude of industries.
